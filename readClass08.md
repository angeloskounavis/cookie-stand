## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

* It is basically designed to provide better control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. That makes it easier for us to deal with layouts and column rows.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

* According to the article FlexBox "The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column." (link below).

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

* If you have a lot of data in your flexbox it could potentially cause an issue where it will increase the pages loading time.

## What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

* According to the article Why would you use flexbox instead of floats? "Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its content. We can easily change the order of elements on our webpage without even making changes in HTML." (Link below).

## How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

* Well in the future I would like to develop my skills in JavaScript and Python. I am assuming at that point I'll be responsible of handling a lot of data from companies so knowing how to use a flexbox when needed and when it's not necessary is vital.
